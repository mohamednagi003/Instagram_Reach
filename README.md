# Instagram Post Impressions Prediction
This project aims to predict the number of impressions on Instagram posts using machine learning models. Two models have been used for prediction: Linear Regression and LinearSVR. The project involves the use of various features such as likes, comments, shares, and other post metadata to estimate the impressions.

# Introduction
With the increasing influence of social media, especially Instagram, analyzing user engagement metrics like impressions can help in optimizing content strategies. Impressions represent the total number of times a post has been seen by users. In this project, we focus on predicting Instagram post impressions using machine learning techniques.

We have implemented two models to achieve this goal:

Linear Regression
LinearSVR
# Models and Results
Linear Regression Model:

Achieved a score of 0.98.
This model fits a linear relationship between features (like likes, comments, and shares) and the target variable (impressions).
LinearSVR Model:

Achieved a higher score of 0.999.
LinearSVR is a Support Vector Regression technique that minimizes errors in a more robust way, which provided superior performance in our case.
The LinearSVR model outperformed Linear Regression in this project, suggesting that it is better suited for predicting Instagram impressions.

# Why LinearSVR?
The LinearSVR model was chosen because:

Robustness to Outliers: Instagram post data can have outliers, such as posts going viral unexpectedly. LinearSVR, by using support vectors and minimizing the error outside a margin, is less sensitive to outliers compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) used in Linear Regression.
Better Generalization: While Linear Regression tends to minimize the sum of squared errors across the entire dataset, LinearSVR focuses on a margin of tolerance (epsilon), which can lead to better generalization when dealing with unseen data. This was reflected in the superior performance of LinearSVR, which gave a near-perfect score of 0.999.
Minimizing Overfitting: LinearSVR incorporates regularization, reducing the risk of overfitting the data. In the case of Instagram post impressions, where the features may be highly correlated, SVR's ability to avoid overfitting makes it a better choice for predicting engagement metrics.
In conclusion, LinearSVR was more suitable for this task due to its resilience in handling noisy data, its ability to generalize better to new posts, and its capability to handle large variances between posts.

# Data
The data used in this project consists of several features commonly associated with Instagram posts, such as:

Number of likes
Number of comments
Number of shares
Time since post creation
Type of content (image, video, carousel)
The dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can use your own Instagram engagement dataset or generate one using Instagram API.
